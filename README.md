# Study Aims
The overall aim of this study is to improve nutrient circulation and resource efficiency in an existing recirculating integrated multi-trophic aquaculture(IMTA) system culturing sea urchin Parechinus angulosus and green seaweed Ulva lacinulata. The capacity of marine polychaete Arenicola loveni to reduce and mineralize particulate byproducts from P. angulosus for enhancing the growth of U. lucinulata will be assessed. The study will also assess the nutritional value of A. loveni for potential alternative uses. 

# Study design
Replicate recirculating systems will be contructed for aquaculture of P. angulosus fed forumated feed and U. lacinulata. A seperate component of the aquaculture system will house A. loveni sustained with particulate byproducts produced from P. angulosus (uneaten feed and faeces). U. lacinulata will also be cultured in a seperate component for removal of dissolved nutrients that are produced by P. angulosus and A. loveni. Water and sediment samples will be used to track dissolved nitrogen and phosporus concentration in the system and organic matter content in A. loveni tanks respectively. The extent of nutrient re-circulation in the IMTA system will be evaluated from the data. 

# Specific objectives of the study include: 
- assessing dissolved and particulate byproducts from P. angulosus aquaculture, and also the nurtitional value of particulate byproducts
- size class determination of particulate byproducts from P. angulosus and A. loveni sediment particles
- assess feeding (build up) and mineralizaion of particulate byproducts in A. loveni tanks 
- testing for differences in nutritional make-up of A. loveni individuals grown on the study diet
- testing for differences in Ulva nutrition composition grown on effluent of A. loveni
