# Study Aims
The overall aim of this study is to improve nutrient circulation and resource efficiency in an existing recirculating integrated multi-trophic aquaculture(IMTA) system culturing sea urchin Parechinus angulosus and green seaweed Ulva lacinulata. The capacity of marine polychaete Arenicola loveni, cultured as an additional extractive species in the system, to reduce and mineralize particulate byproducts from P. angulosus will be assessed for enhanced growth of U. lucinulata. The study will also assess the nutritional value of A. loveni for a potential ingredient in fish feeds and alternative uses. 

# Study design
Replicate recirculating systems will be contructed for aquaculture of P. angulosus fed forumated feed and U. lacinulata. A. loveni will be sustained in seperate tanks with particulate byproducts produced from P. angulosus (uneaten feed and faeces). U. lacinulata will also be cultured for removal of dissolved nutrients that are produced by P. angulosus and A. loveni. To deduce the extent of nutrient re-circulation in the IMTA system, water and sediment samples will be taken for dissolved nitrogen and phosporus concentration in the different species compartments and organic matter content in A. loveni tanks respectively. 

Specific objectives of the study include: 
- profiling the amount of dissolved and particulate byproducts from P. angulosus aquaculture, and also the nurtitional value of particulate byproducts
- assess feeding (build up) and mineralizaion of particulate byproducts in A. loveni tanks throughout the study trial period  
- monitor growth of U. lacinulate .................. 


# Sampling and data collection
- Water samples will be collected from replicate aquaculture systems for analysis of dissolved nutrients i.e. nitrogen and phosphorus.
